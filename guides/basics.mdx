## Key concepts

This section describes the core building blocks in forget.work.

<Note>
  If you tell me what the actual objects are called in your product (e.g., tasks, notes, cards, items, reminders), I’ll align all wording and examples.
</Note>

- **Items**: The things you capture so you don’t forget them.
- **Organization**: Any way you group items (for example: lists, tags, folders, or projects).

## Common actions

- Create an item
- Find an item
- Update an item
- Complete/archive an item

## Good defaults

- Capture first, organize second
- Keep names short and searchable
- Review regularly so your list stays trusted
