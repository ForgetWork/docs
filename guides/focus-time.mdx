## Start focusing

To start tracking focus time in the latest version of forget.work, click the **Focus** button at the top of the task list.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/focus-button.png"
    alt="Focus button above the task list"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Focus window

After you click **Focus**, a small sticky window will open and remain on your screen while you work. This is useful because you don’t have to keep going back to the main forget.work page with the full task list — you can keep focusing on the actual task while still keeping an eye on progress.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/focus-window.png"
    alt="Sticky focus window showing time progress"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Focus window actions

From the focus window, you can:

- Complete the current task
- View the time left
- Skip to the next task
- Go back to the previous task

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/focus-window-actions.png"
    alt="Focus window actions for completing, skipping, and going back"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Why is this useful?

Tracking productivity is a great way to stay motivated and focused.

However, manually tracking your productivity is tedious and
time-consuming.

With focus time tracking, you can measure your productivity as you work.

Focus time can provide great insight when you use [Wrap day](/guides/wrap-day).

It can also be used to track and hit your [daily goal](/guides/daily-goal).
